tuples vs lists:
tuples cannot be extended or shortened. Its static
But tuples are faster to traverse.


Using Generators dont have to store things in memory
Generator: A function that yeilds result: Then run another loop using that genrator to throw final values

Generator(throws one value at a time.) No extra memory usage. No time to buld a generator but data is also not there.
When you loop: ok When you mak list: same time and memory as list comprehension.
